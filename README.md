AutoCAD Data Extraction System
The AutoCAD Data Extraction System is a robust software solution designed to automate the extraction of annotations, handwritten text, and labels from AutoCAD sheets. This tool streamlines the tedious process of manually converting AutoCAD data into structured formats, enabling users to efficiently organize and analyze technical information.

The system allows users to convert extracted data into Excel spreadsheets and visualize it via an interactive dashboard, making it highly beneficial for engineers, architects, and project managers.

Key Features:
File Selection Interface:
A clean and minimal GUI where users can upload AutoCAD files.
Data Visualization Dashboard:
An interactive dashboard that provides insights into extracted data.
Real-time updates on progress with clear labels and tooltips.
Excel Export:
Export extracted data into structured Excel files for further analysis.
Data Processing:
Written in Python, utilizing Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
OpenCV for preprocessing AutoCAD files.
Pandas and Matplotlib for data structuring and visualization.

Technologies Used
Python
Tesseract OCR
OpenCV
Pandas
